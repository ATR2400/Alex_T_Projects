#Quickcalc

Quickcalc is a simple calculator made in Windows forms. It makes use of MxParser to accomplish mathematical computation. it currently includes rudimentary arithmetic
(The BEDMAS functions) and a simple graphing calculator 

Note: The graphing calculator was implemented using the winforms chart control. The chart control is meant for visualization of data, not graphing 
equations. As such in order to allow asymptotes to exist the graph had to be set to point instead of line, otherwise any graphs with asymptotes would simply 
look terrible. If I were to make an updated implementation I would use more sophisticated libraries that allow better graphing of algebraic equations
