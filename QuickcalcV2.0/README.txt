Updated version of Quickcalc with a new and improved graphing calculator. V1 had a broken graphing calculator due to a poor choice in windows forms control
V2.0 uses oxyplot to accurately graph algebraic equations. It even supports discontinuous functions! The oxyplot chart also supports scrolling and zooming for a better
viewing experience!

The chart may not always update correctly by itself. Simply zoom in or out a little and it will update right away.
